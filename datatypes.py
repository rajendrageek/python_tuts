# In programming, data types is an important concept
# Variables can store data of different types and different types can do different things
# python has the following data types built in by default, in these categories:

# text type     str
# Numeric type  int, float, complex
# Sequence type list, tuple, range
# Mapping type  dict
# Set type      set, frozenset
# Boolean type  bool
# Binary types  bytes, bytearray, memoryview

# Getting the data type
# You can get the data of any object by using the type function

# Print the data type of any object by using the type() function
# Print the data type of x 
x = 5
print(type(x))
