# Casting

# There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable
# This can be done with casting. Python is an object oriented language, and as such it uses classes to define
# to define datatypes including its primitive types

# Casting in python is therefore done using constructor function
# int constructs an integer number from integer literal, a float literal or a string literal
# flaot() constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string literal
# str constructs a string  from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and flaot literals

# int
x = int(1)
y = int(2.8)
z = int('3')
print(x, y, z)

# flaot
x = float(1)
y = float(2.8)
z = float('2.8')
w = float('4')

print(x, y, z, w)

# string
x = str('s1')
y = str(2)
z = str(3.0)
w = str('5.8')

print(x, y, z, w)
